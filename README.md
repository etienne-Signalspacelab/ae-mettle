	<b>1. mono 360</b><br>
	Start here. Adding new 2.5D graphics to 360 mono video is fairly straightforward.
</p>
<p>
	<b>2. stereo 360</b><br>
	Adding stereo to the above example requires an extra step, the creation of an over-under composite.
</p>
<p>
	<b>3. cineware 360</b><br>
	The Cineware plugin supports stereo 360 rendering, so you can add 2.5D graphics to a scene you created in Cinema 4D, as long as the camera is stationary.
</p>
<p>
	<b>4. volumetric 3D</b><br>
	You can create a true 3D camera move using just the Cineware plugin and a standard AE camera. However, since AE itself has no 360 3D rendering capability, you can't output 360 video with this method.
