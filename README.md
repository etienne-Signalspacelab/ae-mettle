<h1>Mettle / Immersive Video plugins for After Effects examples</h1>
<p>
	<b>1. mono 360</b><br>
	Adding new 2.5D graphics to 360 mono video is fairly straightforward.
</p>
<p>
	<b>2. stereo 360</b><br>
	Adding stereo to the above example requires an extra step, the creation of an over-under composite.
</p>
<p>
	<b>3. volumetric</b><br>
	Using the Cineware plugin and a standard AE camera, you can create a true 3D camera move through 360 footage and add 2.5D graphics on top. (However, since AE has no 360 3D rendering capability, you can't output 360 video with this method.)
